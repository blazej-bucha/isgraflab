# Introduction

isGrafLab (Irregular Surface GRAvity Field LABoratory) is a modified version of
[GrafLab](https://github.com/blazej-bucha/graflab) to perform accurate and fast
computation of functionals of the geopotential at dense grids residing on
irregular surfaces such as the Earth's surface. It employs the lumped
coefficients approach for surface spherical harmonic synthesis of gravity field
quantities and their vertical derivatives at regular surfaces (sphere or
ellipsoid of revolution), and then it continues the quantities to the irregular
surface using the Talor series.


# Documentation

If you want just a brief introduction to isGrafLab, see
[docs/user-manual.md](docs/user-manual.md).

Detailed isGrafLab cookbook is available at
[https://github.com/blazej-bucha/graflab-cookbook](https://github.com/blazej-bucha/graflab-cookbook).

The equations implemented in isGrafLab can be found in the documentation of
[GrafLab](https://github.com/blazej-bucha/graflab) (see the `docs` folder
therein).

# Disclaimer

isGrafLab is an old project that breaks almost all of the best practices in
terms of coding and documenting standards. Nonetheless, the package seems to
work correctly, it has been thoroughly tested and the computation speed is
reasonable (as far as it is possible in MATLAB). Hoping it might still be
useful to others, isGrafLab remains being publicly available.
